    <p>406 Records is a home studio that does not charge by the hour. In my experience, charging by the hour can lead to rushed recording sessions and a poor product.</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about pricing, please contact me with details about your project and I'll give you a quote. I am more interested in making your music sound great than I am in making money.</p>
